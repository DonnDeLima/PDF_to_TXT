develop data-driven policies that addresses the community issues more effectively. More-
over the study promotes the use of AI-driven analytics in governance, fostering innovation
in public service delivery.

Community. The Rinconada-Bikol community and other local language speakers will
benefit from this research, as it supports language preservation and technological repre-
sentation. By facilitating the development of sentiment analysis in Rinconada-Bikol lan-
guage,this research contributes to ensuring the language’s relevance and integrated into
modern technologies, promoting culture and lingual diversity.

Researchers. This study serves as an opportunity for the researchers to contribute to
the field of natural language processing by exploring sentiment classification in a low-
resource language like RBL-Nabua. Through the comparative analysis of traditional ma-
chine learning and deep learning approaches, the authors gain hands-on experience in data
preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using linguistic data unique to
the community.

Future Researchers. By providing the foundation for creating sentiment analysis mod-
els tailored to low-resource language, this study offers a valuable reference for future re-

searchers aiming to improve existing sentiment classification systems.

Scope and Limitation

This study focuses on sentiment analysis of the Rinconada-Bikol Language - Nabua Text
by conducting a comparative analysis of traditional machine learning models and neural
network-based approaches. It aims to assess the effectiveness and performance of clas-
sification models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Re-
gression (traditional models), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) (deep learning models).
