CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This chapter provides and overview of the study, including its background, signifi-
cance, objectives, and scope. It discusses the importance of sentiment analysis in Natu-
ral Language Processing (NLP) and highlights the need for research on low-resource lan-
guages, specifically Rinconada Bikol-Nabua. Lastly, it defines key terms relevant to the

study.

Background of the Problem

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield of natural language of
Natural Language Processing (NLP) that is mainly involved in extracting, identifying, and
analyzing subjective information from text data [3]. With the rise of digital communi-
cation and social media platforms, sentiment analysis has been widely applied in fields
such as business intelligence, political discussions, and customer feedback analysis [9].
However, the majority of sentiment analysis research focused on high-resource languages,
particularly English, while many low-resource languages, including regional dialects in the
Philippines, remain underrepresented [4].

In the Philippine context, sentiment analysis has been utilized to assess public opinion
on government agencies and national issues. For instance, a study by Umali et al. [8]
demonstrated how sentiment analysis could be applied to assess citizen sentiment toward
government agencies, analyzing over 14, 506 social media comments to quantify public
perception. Their research highlights a key application of sentiment classification in gover-
nance and decision making. However, their study primarily focused on sentiment analysis

in Filipino and English texts. Overlooking the regional languages such as Rinconada Bikol.
