sentiment classification. The research seeks to determine how traditional machine learning
models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression
perform in classifying sentiment compared to neural network models. Additionally, it ex-
amines the accuracy and precision of sentiment classification when using neural network-
based models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Furthermore, this study investigates
whether there is a significant difference between traditional machine learning models and
neural network approaches in capturing linguistic nuances and sentiment-related patterns

in Rinconada-Bikol Language - Nabua text.

Objectives of the Study

General Objective

This study aims to compare traditional machine learning models and neural network-based
approaches for sentiment classification in Rinconada Bikol Language - Nabua text. It seeks
to determine the most effective model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,
providing insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach. The findings will
contribute to improving sentiment analysis techniques for low-resource languages and help

develop more efficient text classification models.

Specific Objectives

More Specifically, this study aims to:

1. To train traditional machine learning models (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regres-
sion) and neural network models (LSTM, RNN, CNN) for sentiment classification in
Rinconada-Bikol text.

2. To evaluate and compare the performance of these models using standard metrics
