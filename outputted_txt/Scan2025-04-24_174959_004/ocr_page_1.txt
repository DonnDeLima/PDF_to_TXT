Significance of the Study

This study aims to address the need for efficient sentiment classification for low-resource
languages, specifically Rinconada-Bikol. The findings can guide future studies in natural
language processing(NLP) for underrepresented languages and may provide a foundation
for building sentiment analysis systems that cater to low-resource languages. The results
of this study will benefit the following individuals and entities:

Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges(CSPC). The study will contribute to the insti-
tutional body, offering fellow students, teaching staff, and researchers at CSPC a basis for
understanding NLP techniques and their application to low-resource languages, especially
Rinconada-Bikol language.

Faculty and Administration. The faculty and administrators, particularly those par-
taking in teaching and research within the fields of language, computer science, or data
science, will find this study useful as an academic resource. As it offers as a basis for
further research initiatives containing machine learning and deep learning models.

Local Governement Unit. The findings of this study can aid local government units
(LGUs) in understanding public sentiment more effectively, particularly for areas where
RBL-Nabua are widely spoken. By leveraging sentiment classification models, LGUs can
analyze social media discussions, public feedback, and citizen concenrs in real time. This

can enhance their capabilities in decision-making, thus making way for policymakers to
