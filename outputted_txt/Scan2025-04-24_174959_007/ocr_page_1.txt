erarchical representations of text data. The performances of each models will be
evaluated and compared. These neural network based models will also be used along
with traditional machine learning models to for sentiment analysis. Results from
the evaluation of each models will provide insights into the effectiveness of machine
learning and deep learning models for sentiment classification in the context of a low

resource language like Rinconada Bikol Langauge - Nabua variant.

Low-Resource Language. A language with limited linguistic resources, such as
annotated datasets, pre-trained models, and computational tools for NLP. Rinconada
Bikol, particularly Nabua variant, is considered a low-resource language due to the

lack of large-scale sentiment corpora and trained models [1, 6].

Text Processing. A series of data cleaning steps applied to raw text before sentiment
classification. These steps typically include tokenization, stopword removal, stem-
ming/lemmatization, and noise filtering to enhance model performance [5]. In this
study, Rinconada Bikol Language - Nabua Text dataset will undergo text processing

in order to optimize the training process of the models as well as improve accuracy.

Corpus Linguistics. The study of language through structured text corpora. In this
study, corpus linguistics techniques, such as token frequency analysis, part-of-speech
tagging, and collocation analysis, will be employed to understand sentiment bearing

words in Rinconada Bikol Language [6].
