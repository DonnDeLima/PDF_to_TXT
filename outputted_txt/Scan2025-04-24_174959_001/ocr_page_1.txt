The Rinconada Bikol language, a member of the Austronesian language family, pre-
dominantly spoken in the areas of Camarines Sur , is an underrepresented language. Within
this linguistic group, the Nabua-Balatan variant is notable for its unique phonetic and lex-
ical characteristics. Despite its cultural significance, Rinconada-Bikol lacks substantial
linguistic resources such as annotated datasets pre-trained NLP models which are essential
for effective sentiment analysis [1] .

Addressing this gap, Ofiate and Pandes (2024) (6{ developed a text corpus specifically
for the Nabua variant of Rinconada Bikol. They collected texts from social media and ed-
ucational materials, compiling a dataset of 8,754 words. Utilizing corpus linguistics tools,
they performed analysis including tokenization, term frequency assessment, part-of-speech
tagging, collocation examination. Additionally, they implemented a bag-of-words senti-
ment analyzer, training 500 sentences labeled as positive, negative, or neutral using var-
ious machine learning algorithms. Atneir experimental result shows Fl-scores of 57.83%
for Logistic Regression, 52.08% for Support Vector Machine, 39.98% for Decision Tree
Classifier, and 26.71% for Gaussian Naive Bayes. This pioneering work provides a foun-
dational dataset and initial insights into sentiment analysis for the Nabua-Balatan variant
of Rinconada Bikol.

Traditional machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive
Bayes, and Random Forest, have been widely used for text classification tasks, including
sentiment analysis [7] . These models rely on handcrafted feature and statistical represen-
tations, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF), to classify sentiment in text [5] . While it is effective for structured datasets and
well-documented languages, these approaches often struggle with complex linguistic struc-
tures and limited training data, which are common challenges in low-resource languages
like Rinconada Bikol.

On the other hand, deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNN),

long-short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), have shown
