superior performance in sentiment classification tasks by capturing contextual information
and semantic relationships within text [9] . These models are capable of capturing con-
textual dependencies, learning semantic relationships, and handling variations in sentence
structure. Given the recent advancement in NLP, neural network-based models offer an al-
ternative to traditional machine learning approaches, particularly in cases where annotated
data is limited.

Building upon the foundational work of Ofiate and Pandes[6] , this study aims to con-
duct a comparative analysis of traditional machine learning model and neural network
based models for classifying sentiment in the Nabua-Balatan variant of Rinconada Bikol.
By evaluating the performances of these models, this research seeks to identify the most
effective approach for sentiment classification in the context of a low-resource tegional
language. The findings will contribute to the development of computational tools for Rin-
conada Bikol sentiment analysis and serve as a foundation for future NLP applications in

underrepresented Philippine Languages.

Statement of the Problem

The rapid development of sentiment analysis has largely benefited high-resource languages
like English. However, there is a growing need to address the challenges faced by low-
resource languages, which is the lack of datasets, linguistic tools, and pre-trained models
necessary for effective sentiment analysis[2]. Additionally, while both traditional machine
learning classifiers and neural network models have been widely used for sentiment classi-
fication in various languages, their performance in clssifying sentiment in Rinconada Bikol
Language - Nabua remains unexplored.

As such, this study will focus on comparing the performance of traditional machine
learning models and neural network approaches for sentiment analysis in Rinconada-Bikol

Language - Nabua. It aims to evaluate which method provides more accurate and efficient
