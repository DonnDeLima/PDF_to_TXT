methods will be applied before training the models. The study will compare classification
performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

However, this study is limited to text-based sentiment classification and does not ex-
tend to speech, real-time sentiment analysis, or multi-modal data processing (e.g., images,
videos, or audio). It does not explore complex linguistic phenomena such as sarcasm, irony,
or implicit sentiment expressions that require deeper contextual understanding. The re-
search will not include real-time data scraping and will focus only on existing text datasets.
Additionally, texts with heavy code-switching between Rinconada-Bikol and other lan-
guages will not be the primary focus. While the study provides insights into sentiment
classification for a low-resource language, it will not involve large-scale deployment or “—

real-time implementation.

+ Sentiment Analysis. The process of using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
machine learning techniques to determine the polarity (positive, negative, or neu-
tral) of text-based data, commonly applied to social media analysis, product reviews,
and public opinion mining [3]. In this study, sentiment analysis will be applied to

* Machine Learning Models. A category of statistical learning algorithms, including
Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, that are widely used for
text classification tasks [7, 5]. These traditional machine learning algorithms will be

used in sentiment analysis of Rinconada Bikol Language - Nabua Text.
